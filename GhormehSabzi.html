                <h2>Steps:</h2>
                <ol>
                <li> Start the stew. In a large pot or dutch oven, add a generous drizzle of oil, and cook the onions over medium heat when it’s hot. Saute the onions until they’re slightly golden. Then add the minced garlic, ground turmeric, and black pepper. When the garlic is fragrant, stir in the meat and let it sear evenly all over. Season the meat with salt, the bouillon cube, and add the water. Bring the stew to a simmer, then lower the heat and simmer uncovered for an hour.</li>
                <li>Simmer simmer simmer. Poke holes in the dried limes with a fork or a paring knife. Then add them to the stew. Cover the pot with a lid but leave a sliver so that the stew vents.</li>
                <li>Saute the herbs. When there’s roughly 20 minutes left. Add a glug of oil to a large skillet or deep saute pan and add the herbs over medium-high heat. Saute the greens until they wilt down to less than half the size. I use dried fenugreek and add that in during the last two minutes.</li>
                <li>Simmer again. Add the greens to the stew along with the drained kidney beans, cover the pot with a sliver to vent and let it simmer again for an hour. The theme here is simmer! The lower and slower you cook this, the more tender the meat and the more flavorful the stew!</li>
                <li>Serve it up. Remove the dried limes and keep them to the side if you plan on serving them with the stew. Check the meat to see if it’s done with a paring knife. If the knife goes through with some resistance, let it simmer for longer until it’s super tender. When the meat is done, add the lemon juice. Taste and adjust with more salt as the stew needs. Then serve it up with tahdig or basmati rice and shirazi salad.</li>
                </ol>
